---+++ Phase 1
   * Cross platform, must be capable of running on Windows, Mac OS X  and Linux (initially just a tar.gz but ideally RPM and Debian versions as well)
   * Ability to share the password file among several locations, if it's updated on one machine then it should be automatically/semi-automatically copied on to all machines using that file
   * Fast, needs to be quick to start and use
   * Quick and easy to access search (like the search in iTunes)
   * Phonetic password, i.e. allow for the ability to see the password in the NATO phonetic alphabet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet)
   * Allow passwords to be organised into groups
   * Strong encryption
   * Copy username, password
   * Clear clipborad when closing
   * Keep main window on top
   * Easy to internationalise
   * Store nothing in memory in plain text (especialy the master password)

---+++ Phase 2
   * Automatically check for updates
   * Password generation (lc chars, uc chars, numbers, symbols)
   * Password file backup (automatic)
   * On screen keyboard
   * Password, Challenge/response phrases, pin number
   * Run from portable media
