*Signature:* extends FlatPackObject

---+++ Attributes
   * Account Name
   * User id
   * Password
   * URL
   * Notes

Each of these attributes should have a getter and setter.

The _set_ method for each attribute (except the accout name) should encrypt the data before storing it in memory. This way nothing important is ever left unencrypted. The _get_ methods will then need to decrypt before returning the cleartext.
